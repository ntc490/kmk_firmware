- TODO:
  - Add status LEDs
  - wrist rests (one way or another)
  - separate mapping layers into left and right
  - Add "jiggler" module
  - Add hand detection module to switch layers - mouse-control-layer
  - Morse code beeper/vibrator support
  - snake/kebab/camel case mode (space bar mod)

- HOW IT WORKS
  - coord mapping is determined by the KMK Keyboard class, unless
    Split() is used as a module. Then it must determine the
    coord_mapping.
  - _on_matrix_changed calls _find_key_in_map(), which gets the index
    of the key from the coord_mapping.
  - coord_mapping contains key numbers. When a key is
    pressed/released, we find the index for the key number in the
    coord_mapping.
  - split_flip only works for matrix-style keyboards with col and row
    pins, so you have to flip the keys in the coord_mapping instead in
    a diode-less setup.
  - key number -> coord_map (index from key#) -> keymap (KC from index)
  - key numbers are just a 'range' from offset to offset + number of
    keys in scanner.
